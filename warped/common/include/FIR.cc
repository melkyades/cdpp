 $Log: FIR.cc,v $
 Revision 1.3  1999/07/16 17:57:58  dmartin
 Removed a debug statement.

 Revision 1.2  1999/07/16 17:49:39  dmartin
 Fixed a bug introduced in 1995 that was making the results of this filter
 incorrect.  Fixed it in a manner so it's still "rollover safe" in terms
 of number of data points entered.

 Revision 1.1  1998/12/01 14:53:48  dmartin
 Moved all of the "utils" to the common subdirectory.  Changed some
 #includes to reflect this.

 Started an "install" target for the Sequential kernel.

 Is anyone trying these changes, btw?  I've not heard any complaints or
 otherwise, and that frightens me a little :-)

 Revision 1.1  1998/03/07 21:11:52  dmadhava
 Moved the files in the old "warped" directory down by a level. The new
 hierarchy is

       warped
         |
         +----- TimeWarp (The files in warped are now here)
         |
         +----- Sequential
         |
         +----- NoTime

 Revision 1.5  1997/11/13 23:37:37  gsharma
 Modified some code to make FIR.cc CC compiler compliant.

 Revision 1.4  1995/10/03 15:18:43  cyoung
 bug fix on the FIR. (fixed a problem with it overflowing).

 Revision 1.3  1995/08/17 17:18:13  tmcbraye
 Modified to compile cleanly with -Wall.

 Revision 1.2  1995/08/15 20:45:27  dmartin
 Update with Chris's changes.

 Revision 1.2  1995/08/15 16:42:59  cyoung
 Bug fix that could cause a bad conversion for unsigned ints.

 Revision 1.1.1.1  1995/08/14 20:23:09  dmartin
 The warped system.

// FIR.cc
// This template class implements an nth order FIR filter, where n
// is specified by the user.  To use it, #include "FIR.cc" at the top of
// the file you'd like to use it in.  Then include a declaration similar
// to the following:
// FIR<double> filter(3)
//
// Replace "double" with whatever type you'd like it to input and output,
// and "3" with whatever order filter you'd like to use.  If you specify
// a 0 or a 1 for a filter order, an error message is generated.
