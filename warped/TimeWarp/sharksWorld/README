The SharksWorld application,takes in the number of sector/row ,
Sectorwidth, Number of Sharks and fishes and Number of LPs in a Config
file and Simulates accordingly.  The config file is used so that we need
to compile only once.

The executable is generated in SHARK.The SimUntil,the value of GVT until
which U want to simulate must be given in the main file.

The Number of Events that are processed and hence the size of the
Simulation can be increased by increasing the number of Sharks/fishes and
the Simuntil value.

The executable can be got using the Makefile provided.

U need a file called procgroup which specifies the Processors on which u r
running the simulation.

The application simulates an Ocean with sharks and fishes where a shark
eats any fish that comes within its attack range.The application also
allows for reincarnation of the fishes to ensure that the Simulation
always has some events to process till the Simuntil value specified by the
user.
