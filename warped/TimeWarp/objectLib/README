The Queuing Model Library
-------------------------

This directory contains the fundamental queuing objects with which you can
model a simple queuing network model.

There are seven basic objects. They are :

		DelayObject.hh		DelayObject.cc 
		ForkObject.hh		ForkObject.cc
		JoinObject.hh		JoinObject.cc
		QueueObject.hh		QueueObject.cc
		ServerObject.hh		ServerObject.cc
		SourceObject.hh		SourceObject.cc

Associated with each object is its state. There will certain aspects of
the model which the user will want to remember during the course of a
simulation. All these variables (for example, statistical data) will have
to be put in the state of the object.

The files QueuingTypes.hh and SidTypes.hh declare the options avaible to
you for modelling particular objects. The fork can be setup to be round
robin, or alternating and so on.
