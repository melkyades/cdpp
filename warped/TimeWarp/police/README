Police Dispatch System Model :
-----------------------------

The police dispatch system model is a simple model of a traffic police
telecommunications network. A random number of calls are received by the
police station and are dispatched for service to different police cars.

The files associated in this model are the following:
	PoliceSourceObject.hh		PoliceSourceObject.cc
	PoliceSourceState.hh		PoliceSourceState.cc

	PoliceForkObject.hh		PoliceForkObject.cc		
	PoliceForkState.hh		PoliceForkState.cc

	PoliceServerObject.hh		PoliceServerObject.cc
	PoliceServerState.hh

	PoliceSinkObject.hh		PoliceSinkObject.cc

The PoliceSourceObject simulates the random number of incoming calls by
sending a fixed set of events every hour for a 24-hour shift. The
PoliceForkObject forwards the call to one of the many police cars
available(police cars are modelled as servers). When the job has been
completed the cars report back to the station through the sink object.
