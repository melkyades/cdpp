The RAID Model
--------------

RAID Disk Arrays are a method that provides a vast array of storage by
using a Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) to provide storage
with a higher I/O performance than several large expensive disks. This
application incorporates a flexible model of a RAID Disk Array using any
one of the three possible disk drives.

Description of files present in this directory:
------------------------------------------------

[a] RAID.config - The RAID configuration file

The RAID configuration file contains the parameters for the RAID
simulation in the following order:

1. the number of source processes to generate requests,
2. the number of fork processes to route requests,
3. the number of disks in the disk array,
4. the number of tokens to be generated by each process, and
5. the number of LPs.

The RAID configuration file should be named "RAID.config", and there
should be a link, called RAID.config, to this file in the users top level
directory.
