Requirements
------------
g++ 2.6.3 or newer, preferably the newest available.  At the time of
release, it was 2.7.2.1.

mpich (or possibly another implementation of MPI) - only if you want
to run parallel or distributed on workstations.  Information on mpich
can be found at:
(http://www.mcs.anl.gov/home/lusk/mpich/index.html)

In order to compile any of the examples included in this distribution,
the Makefiles will need slight modifications.  (No configuration
scripts yet!)  In the Makefile of the example you're building, you'll
need to point MPIDIR at your installation of mpich.  Also, you'll need
to point DEPENDINC at the g++ include directory of your installation of
g++.

At this point you need a "procgroup" file for mpich to figure out what
machines to start the simulation on.  See the documentation in mpich
for details.

If you want to use the sequential kernel instead of the default parallel
kernel, you have to modify config.hh in the src directory. You need to
specify in the top level Makefile not to use MPI and specify the
SEQUENTIAL flag in config.hh. 

See the file src/README for all of the options available in config.hh.
