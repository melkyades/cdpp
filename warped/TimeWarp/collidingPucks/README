The Colliding Pucks application,takes in the number of sector/row n,
Sectorwidth Number of Pucks and Number of LPs in a Config file and
Simulates accordingly.  The config file is used so that we need to compile
only once.

The executable is generated in PUCK.The SimUntil,the value of GVT until
which U want to simulate must be given in the main file.

The Number of Events that are processed and hence the size of the
Simulation can be increased by increasing both the number of Pucks and the
Simuntil value.

The executable can be got using the Makefile provided.

U need a file called procgroup which specifies the Processors on which u r
running the simulation.

The Application Simulates a table with a number of Pucks on it.These Pucks
move with different velocities in different directions.The application
mimmicks the effects of the collision of these pucks.Inorder to this the
table is divided into a number of sectors which monitor the Pucks within
the sector.These sectors r modelled as Simulation Objects.The Simulation
goes on till the GVT reaches the SimUntil value specified by the user.
