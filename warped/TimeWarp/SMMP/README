The SMMP Model:
---------------

The symmetric multiprocessor model works off the objectLib
directory. There are a few specialised objects which are used to model
this application. The special objects are:

	MemEvents.hh	
	MemRouterObject.hh	MemRouterObject.cc   
	MemSourceObject.hh	MemSourceObject.cc
	MemSourceState.hh	MemSourceState.cc

There is a special file provided for generating the main.cc file. This
file is MemGen.cc. The makefile will first run MemGen to create the
main.cc before compiling the rest of the files. MemGen creates the main.cc
file for you. It will ask you to enter a set of parameters and it will use
these parameters to create and partition the main.cc file for you.

The set of parameters are as follows:
[a] Number of SMMP processors
[b] Sequential or Parallel Simulation
[c] Number of physical processors (or LPs)
[d] Speed of cache (integer value)
[e] Cache hit ratio (fraction e.g. 0.85)
[f] Speed of main memory (integer value, typically slower than the cache
                          speed)
[g] Number of requests per processor
[h] Name of file to generate


Note that MPI calls are included in the main.cc file even if you wanted
only a one processor simulation. So the procgroup file must always contain
the correct number of processors being used in the simulation.

The rest of the objects refered to in the main.cc file are present in the
objectLib directory.
