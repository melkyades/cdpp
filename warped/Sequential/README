This directory contains warped's Sequential kernel.

The Sequential Kernel is capable of selecting the InputQueues at
run-time. The InputQueue implementation to be chosen can be specified in a
file called "InputQConfig". An entry of 0 specifies a linear list
implementation and 1 implies SplayTree implementation. If the file is not
found or any other value is found, SplayTree implementation is chosen as
default, as this implementation provides excellent performance under most
circumstances.

If explicit selection of the queue type is desired, the file InputQConfig
should to be in the directory where the application is executed with a
single entry specifying 0 or 1.
